## Project Description

The Amazin Online Bookstore Management System is a web application designed to facilitate purchasing books and seamless management of book-related information for both bookstore owners and customers. This system allows bookstore owners to upload, edit, and manage book details such as ISBN, pictures, descriptions, authors, and publishers. Customers can use the system to purchase books uploaded by owners by easily searching for books based on various criteria or browsing through the bookstore's collection and adding them to their shopping carts. The system also analyzes past user purchases to generate personalized book recommendations and suggest them to the user.
